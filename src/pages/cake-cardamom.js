        <section>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>200g unsalted butter chopped into small cubes, room temp</li>
                <li> 1 cup sugar</li>
                <li> 1 tbsp vanilla essence</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup almond meal</li>
                <li>2 cups white spelt flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup roughly chopped walnuts</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li> Seeds of 10 cardamom pods, finely ground or finely chopped</li>
                <li> 1/2- 3/4 cup milk (enough to make the mix moist)</li>
                <li>3 bananas, sliced into rounds</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat oven to 180°C</li>
                <li>In a big bowl, beat the butter, sugar and vanilla extract until the butter is pale and fluffy. This
                    takes me
                    about 10-15 minutes using an electric hand mixer.
                </li>
                <li>Chop or grind the cardamom seeds until they’re as fine as you can get them.</li>
                <li>Break 3 eggs into a mug and slowly add, one at a time to the butter mix, whilst still beating. Once
                    you’ve
                    added
                    all 3 eggs keep beating another minute or so. You really must add the eggs slowly and one at a time
                    and beat well or the mixture may appear to curdle a bit. Although if it does don’t worry too much. I’ve done
                    it loads of times and the cake is still ok.
                </li>
                <li>In a separate bowl put the almond meal, spelt flour, walnuts, cardamom and baking powder.Mix well
                    with a wooden spoon to ensure the baking powder is evenly mixed in . Add flour mix to the butter and egg
                    mix.
                </li>
                <li>Then add the milk and beat on a low speed until the ingredients are just mixed together.</li>
                <li>This is the cake base mix complete. We will be using it again in future recipes (some, minus the
                    cardamom – others with different flour, nut, fruit and chocolate options).
                </li>
                <li>Grease a 12″ tart tin with butter and line with baking paper. You need to ensure the baking paper
                    comes up high above the edges as the tart will rise! I usually put a baking sheet under the tin in case of
                    any slight overflow.
                </li>
                <li>Pour the cake mix into the lined cake tin and spread evenly with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Arrange the banana slices on the top of the cake and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake for 50 – 60 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
                <li>The cake is ready when you slide a knife into the centre and it comes out with only very small
                    traces of cake mix. This cake is usually very moist.
                </li>
                <li>Leave to cool for 20 minutes. Then remove from tin and place on a rack to cool further. Once cooled
                    remove the baking paper.
                </li>
                <li>Serve warm or cold with a dollop of natural yoghurt.</li>
            </ul>
