    <p>The past few weeks I’ve been playing with some new ingredients. In my quest to bake a decent cake with no butter, sugar or eggs I’ve begun work on removing butter – and had some success on the sugar front.

    Replacing the butter, I’ve used coconut oil, which I’ve found works brilliantly as long as I also use it in conjunction with olive oil (50/50). If I don’t use olive oil the first part of the cake process (oil and sugar) doesn’t go white and fluffy. So the olive oil is great for adding volume.

    I tried using agave syrup the other week – I used the same amount as sugar but it was far too sweet and made the cake go quite dark so that was no good. I’ve been told to try light Agave next time. In the meantime though I found my favourite honey brand from New Zealand has arrived in the UK, so I bought a jar of Northern Rata to use as my cake sweetener.

    This time I used half honey / half sugar, alongside my half coconut / half olive oil mix. Complicated – but so far so good. And good honey isn’t cheap so the sugar stays for now.

    My new discovery this week was Einkorn flour – the oldest flour known to mankind. It’s a lovely wholemeal flour and as I like to use a few different flours in my baking I’m happy to add this to the collection. You can substitute it out for spelt or anything else if you can’t find any.

    You can also turn this recipe into cupcakes if you like – we did it once and they were lovely. Just decrease the baking time to around 15 minutes and bake until golden brown.

    You will need

    90g coconut oil
    90g olive oil
    1/2 cup honey
    1/2 cup unrefined caster sugar
    1 tsp vanilla essence

    3 eggs

    1 cup Einkorn flour
    1 cup white Spelt flour
    1 cup Almond meal (ground almonds)
    1/4 cup ground walnuts
    1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, coconut chips
    1 TBSP poppy seeds

    3 tsp baking powder

    1/2 cup milk

    Finely grated rind of 2 lemons

    How to make

    Pre-heat oven to 180°C. We don’t have a fan oven so please ensure you don’t use fan bake.
    In a mixer, mix (using the egg whip attachment) together the oils, honey, sugar and vanilla essence until white and fluffy (about 10 minutes).

    Gradually beat in the eggs one at a time ensuring each one is thoroughly mixed before adding the next.

    In a separate bowl mix the dry ingredients together using a wooden spoon. Then add the lemon rind and mix through.

    Add the dry ingredients and then the milk to the oil and egg mix. Blend again briefly to combine the ingredients all together. Don’t over mix.

    Grease and line a shallow 12″ tart tin with baking paper – ensuring the baking paper is almost double the height of the sides of the tart tin. I use baking tin liners from Lakeland which are like giant cupcake liners. No more greasing or cutting up baking paper for me!

    Pour your cake mix into the lined tin and smooth with a spatula.

    Bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown. You will know the cake is done if the centre doesn’t wobble when you gently shake the cake tin on the oven shelf – or the usual way of testing with a knife. The knife should only have a few grains of almond meal on it when you pull it back out.

        Remove from tin and cool on a wire rack.</p>
