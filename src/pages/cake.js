    This is one of the many cakes I bake using this simple base – and I cook them as tarts, in a shallow tart tin. The raspberry is lovely and tart and the cacao nibs (coarsely ground cocoa beans) are a raw, natural version of chocolate chips which are brilliantly crunchy and not at all sweet. In our home this cake is often eaten for breakfast and never lasts longer than a day.

    For where to buy see bottom of post.

    You will need…

    180g butter, cubed
    1 1/3 cups sugar
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    3 eggs
    2 cups ground almonds*
    1 cup white spelt flour
    3 tsp baking powder
    1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
    1/2 cup cacao nibs
    A small handful of sunflower and pumpkin seeds
    1/2 – 3/4 cup milk (enough to give you a not-too-dry but not-runny-either consistency)
    300g frozen raspberries
    How to make…

    Pre-heat oven to 180°C
    Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla until white and fluffy.
    Then, slowly – one at a time, beat in the eggs, beating well after each egg. If you add them all at once or too quickly the mixture will curdle.
    In a separate bowl mix together the flours and the baking powder with a wooden fork.
    Add in the walnuts, cacao nibs and seeds and mix until combined.
    Add the flour mix to the butter mix, and add the milk.
    Gently fold together with a spatula.
    Pour into a lined* 12″ tart tin (I use the amazing cake tin liners from Lakeland) and cover with a single layer of frozen raspberries.
    Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown and firm. If the cake is still wobbly in the middle it’s not done!
    Test for readiness by inserting a skewer or knife into the cake. If it comes out with only a few grains of ground almonds it’s ready. This cake is better a bit undercooked than overcooked.
    This cake is rather good warm.

    * You need to ensure your paper lining is quite a bit higher than the tart tin as this tart will rise. For your first time baking this tart I recommend you put a baking sheet on the oven shelf below the tart tin in case of any overflow.
