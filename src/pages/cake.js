            <h3>You will need…</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>180g butter, cubed</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups ground almonds*</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups white spelt flour</li>
                <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 – 3/4 cup milk (enough to give you a not-too-dry but not-runny-either consistency)</li>
                <li>300g frozen raspberries</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to make…</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-heat oven to 180°C</li>
                <li>Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla until white and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Then, slowly – one at a time, beat in the eggs, beating well after each egg. If you add them all at
                    once or
                    too quickly the mixture will curdle.
                </li>
                <li>In a separate bowl mix together the flours and the baking powder with a wooden fork.</li>
                <li>Add the flour mix to the butter mix, and add the milk.</li>
                <li>Gently fold together with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Pour into a lined* 12″ tart tin (I use the amazing cake tin liners from Lakeland) and cover with a
                    single
                    layer of frozen raspberries and push them into the make mix with your palms.
                </li>
                <li>Bake for 50 minutes or until golden brown and firm. If the cake is still wobbly in the middle it’s
                    not done!
                </li>
                <li>Test for readiness by inserting a skewer or knife into the cake. If it comes out with only a few
                    grains of
                    ground almonds it’s ready. This cake is better a bit undercooked than overcooked.
                </li>
            </ul>
