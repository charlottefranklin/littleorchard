    <h1>River Cafe lemon tart</h1>
    <em>Recipe stolen from <a href="https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/recipe/lemon-crostata">here</a></em>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>350g plain flour</li>
      <li>225g cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
      <li>100g icing sugar, sifted</li>
      <li>18 eggs: 6 whole eggs and 12 egg yolks</li>
      <li>7 lemons, finely grated zest and juice</li>
      <li>350g caster sugar</li>
      <li>300g unsalted butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> For the sweet pastry, pulse the flour and butter with a pinch of salt in a food processor, until the mixture
        resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Add the icing sugar, followed by 3 of the egg yolks and pulse. The mixture will
        immediately combine and leave the sides of the bowl. Remove the pastry, wrap in cling film and chill in the
        fridge for at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li> Heat the oven to 160°C/fan oven 140°C/mark 3. Coarsely grate half the pastry into a 30cm loose-bottomed
        fluted flan tin, then press it evenly onto the sides and base. Chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Freeze the
        remaining pastry.
      </li>
      <li> Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper and fill with uncooked rice (or dried beans or baking beans).
        Bake blind for 20 minutes. Remove the paper and rice, then bake for a further 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
        Leave to cool.
      </li>
      <li> Meanwhile, make the filling. Put all the remaining ingredients, except the softened butter, in a large
        saucepan over a very low heat and whisk until the eggs have broken up and the sugar has dissolved.
      </li>
      <li> Add 150g of the butter and continue to whisk. At this point, the eggs will start to cook and the mixture will
        thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the remaining butter and continue whisking until the mixture
        becomes very thick. It is important to keep whisking throughout the cooking process to prevent the mixture from
        curdling.
      </li>
      <li> Remove the saucepan from the heat and set it on a cold heatproof surface. Continue to whisk until the mixture
        is lukewarm. Meanwhile, preheat your grill to full heat.
      </li>
      <li> Spoon the lemon filling into the pastry case and leave to settle for 5 minutes. Grill until the top of the
        crostata is mottled brown – this should take 3–5 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
      </li>
    </ul>
