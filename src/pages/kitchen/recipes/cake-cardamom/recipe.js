You really must add the eggs slowly and one at a time and beat well or the mixture may appear to curdle a bit. Although if it does don’t worry too much. I’ve done it loads of times and the cake is still ok."},

            {"text": "Grease a 12″ tart tin with butter and line with baking paper. You need to ensure the baking paper comes up high above the edges as the tart will rise! I usually put a baking sheet under the tin in case of any slight overflow."},
