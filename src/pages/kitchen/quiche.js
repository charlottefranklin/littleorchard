    <h1>Tuna and leek quiche</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quantity short pastry</li>
      <li>2 leeks, sliced</li>
      <li>Knob of butter</li>
      <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 cans tuna, drained</li>
      <li>6 eggs</li>
      <li>250ml organic creme fraiche</li>
      <li>100ml good, thick organic cream</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pre-heat the oven to 180° on fan-setting. If you have a slow oven cook at 200°.</p>
    <p>Grease an 11″ flan dish and line with pastry. Poke the pastry base with a fork (about 10 times). Cover pastry
      with baking paper and use either baking beans or any dried beans to hold the paper down while you blind bake the
      pastry
      shell for 10 minutes or until very very very slightly golden brown. Remove from oven and set aside.</p>
    <p>In a large frying pan, sweat the leeks in melted butter until transluscent.</p>
    <p>Add tuna and gently stir in to the leek.</p>
    <p>Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk until nicely mixed (ie all yellow and a bit bubbly). Add cream fraiche and
      cream and whisk ingredients together.</p>
    <p>Spoon the leek and tuna mix into the blind-baked pastry shell in the flan dish. Pour the egg and cream fraiche
      mix over the tuna.</p>
    <p>Put in the oven and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown (and if you’re lucky it will puff up a bit like a
      souffle).</p>
